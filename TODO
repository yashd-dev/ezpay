This is a very incomplete project that i plan to continue even after the college project is over. I plan to add more features and make it more secure and robust. I plan to add more features like:

-   Making it more secure, currently the firebase rules are very open
-   Error handling and better UI
-   Adding more features to the digital wallet
-   Implementing a better way to categorize receipts
-   Better Next.js and React practices
